# Open-API-Response

The project is decoupled into backend and frontend, following the concept of headless architecture. Thus making the frontend and backend
independant of each other. Such architecture provides more flexibility to the teams. 

Both the frontend and backend communicate through API's (Application Programmer Interface) where backend is responsible for wrapping all the
required data at specific address and frontend is responsible to use the url to fetch and operate on the data. Sometimes communication through
API require authentication and authorization, since all the API's used were open we didn't require such policy
